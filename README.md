# bmi
A simple Python project that calculates your Body Mass Index (BMI) based on your height and weight.
This project demonstrates user input handling, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements in Python.

Description
The BMI Calculator asks for your weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), then calculates your BMI using the formula:
[BMI = \frac{weight}{height^2}]


It then classifies your BMI into one of the standard health categories:
-Underweight
-Normal weight
-Overweight
-Obese

HOW CODE WORKS
1.Takes user input for weight and height.
2.Converts them into floating-point numbers.
3.Applies the BMI formula: bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
4.Checks which range the BMI falls into:
< 18.5 → Underweight
18.5–24.9 → Normal
25–29.9 → Overweight
>= 30 → Obese
5.Displays both the numeric BMI value and the category neatly.
